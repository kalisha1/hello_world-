Hi there!!
My name is Kalisha Allen. 
2017 is going to be a great year, because I forsee a bright future in Web Design for myself. 
Not only am I getting out of my comfort zone, but also developing my skills a Designer. 
I was fortunate enough to land a spot in Code Louisville, a non-profit organizations that offers extensive software development training.
I look foward to meeting with passion for Software development and building A-plus websites for myself and others. ChoW!
